Real time stock analysis - typ1cal

In this project I have implemented a real time stock analysis of few companies. It's a dynamic data comparison which I implemented with
the help of Quandl. I used few other libraries such as seaborn, matplotlib to show the graphs. Just like in the video, we can 
see the stock of one company or we can compare two companies and check the graphs in real time. 

We also have opening values, closing values and the high and the low value to compare with.
That's the project!
