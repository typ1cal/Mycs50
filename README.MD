The course’s syllabus acknowledges that interactions among classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course’s material but
cautions students that there remains a line between enlisting the
help of another and submitting the work of another. The syllabus
then characterizes both sides of that line, elaborating in detail on
acts considered “reasonable” and “not reasonable” while providing
examples of each. (See Appendix for policy in full.) But the essence
of the course’s policy is this:
Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may
show your code to others, but you may not view
theirs.
To be sure, two students could contrive a scenario in which they
both ask each other for help, but the full policy prescribes guardrails
that disallow.
